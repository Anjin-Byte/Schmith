# Schema Filtering Configuration
#
# This file controls which schemas are included or excluded from DataObject generation.
# These settings are applied consistently across all codegen commands:
# - list: Shows filtered list of DataObjects
# - coverage: Reports what's generated vs filtered
# - packets: Generates prompt packets for filtered schemas
# - generate: Generates C# code for filtered schemas

[categories]
# Include/exclude entire categories of schemas

# Include error response schemas (400Error, 404Error, typ.Error, etc.)
include_errors = false

# Include anonymous/inline schemas (schema:anon/...)
include_anonymous = false

# Include Body/View variant schemas (CustomerBody, CustomerView, etc.)
include_variants = true

# Include primitive type schemas (string, integer, object, array)
include_primitives = false


[patterns]
# Regex patterns for fine-grained control
# Patterns are matched against the clean schema name (e.g., "Customer", "JobBody")

# Schemas matching these patterns are excluded (unless in include_patterns)
# Examples: ".*Body$" excludes CustomerBody, JobBody, etc.
exclude = [
    # ".*Body$",
    # ".*View$",
    # ".*Request$",
    # ".*Response$",
]

# Schemas matching these patterns are always included (overrides exclude and categories)
# Use this to force-include specific schemas that would otherwise be filtered
include = [
    # "CustomerBody",  # Include this specific Body variant
]


[explicit]
# Explicit schema name lists for maximum control
# These take precedence over patterns and categories

# Always exclude these specific schema names
exclude = [
    # "InternalOnlySchema",
    # "DeprecatedCustomer",
]

# Always include these specific schema names (overrides all other filters)
include = [
    # "SpecialSchema",
]
