Generate a C# Trimble XChange DataObject class based on the provided schema information.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use the exact JSON property names from the schema with [JsonPropertyName] attributes
2. Convert JSON field names to PascalCase for C# property names
3. Add [Description] attributes using the field descriptions from the schema
4. Mark required fields with [Required] attribute and use 'required' keyword
5. Mark nullable fields with [Nullable(true)] attribute and use nullable type (e.g., string?)
6. Use 'init' accessors for immutable data objects: { get; init; }
7. Include a [PrimaryKey] attribute ONLY on the main DataObject class (the one ending in 'DataObject'). Do NOT add [PrimaryKey] to nested/helper types. Use the primary_key_field from the schema if provided.
8. If primary_key_needs_selection is true, YOU must select an appropriate primary key field using these criteria in order: (a) prefer fields with 'id' or 'key' in the name, (b) prefer required/non-nullable fields, (c) prefer string or integer types. Add a comment after the PrimaryKey attribute: // [REVIEW: PrimaryKey auto-selected]
9. Primary key fields must be required and non-nullable. Do NOT mark primary key fields with [Nullable(true)] or nullable types.
10. If a field provides Enum values, use a C# enum type for that field and define the enum in the same file. Add [JsonConverter(typeof(JsonStringEnumConverter))] to the enum and apply [JsonStringEnumMemberName("<value>")] to each enum member so serialized values match the schema.
11. If a field has type_unresolved=true, the type could not be resolved from the IR. Use 'object' or 'object?' as the type and add a comment: // [REVIEW: Type unresolved from IR]
12. Add XML summary comments for the class
13. Use appropriate C# types:
    - string for text
    - int/long for integers
    - double/decimal for numbers
    - bool for booleans
    - DateTime for datetime fields
    - DateOnly for date-only fields

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- namespace declarations
- using directives
Start directly with the XML summary comment for the class.

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the C# class definition, no explanations or markdown.

PAGING NOTE:
- Include only the fields listed for this page.
