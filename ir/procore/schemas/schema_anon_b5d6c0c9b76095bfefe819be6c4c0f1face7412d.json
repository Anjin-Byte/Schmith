This represents construction contract line item classification for direct contract billing and change order tracking. It maps labor time to specific contract deliverables or bid line items and is used for progress billing and client invoicing based on contract structure. Works with traditional cost code systems but not with modern WBS/Task code approaches. See [List Line Item Types](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/timesheets#list-line-item-types) to retrieve available line item types for your company.\n",
