  "description": "The ID of the Work Breakdown Structure (Task Code) for this timecard entry. This is the preferred modern approach over cost_code_id. In the timecard context, \"WBS code\" specifically refers to Task Codes - the modern construction project task hierarchy that represents specific construction tasks or activities rather than generic cost categories. This directly links labor time to project schedule tasks for better progress tracking and is the modern replacement for traditional cost codes, providing more granular project control. See [List Project WBS Task codes](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/task-codes-field-productivity#list-project-wbs-task-codes) to retrieve available task codes for your project.\n",
