  "description": "Automatically calculates overtime based on company rules. Only applies when completing an in-progress timecard entry or creating a non-in-progress entry. May split entry into multiple time types. A single 12-hour entry may automatically split into 8 hours regular plus 4 hours overtime. This ensures construction time entries comply with complex union overtime rules and prevailing wage requirements. The company must have overtime management enabled with configured rulesets. When true, timecard_time_type_id will be ignored and can be omitted. See [List Overtime Rulesets](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/overtime-rulesets#list-overtime-rulesets) and [List Timecard Time Types](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/timecard-time-types#list-timecard-time-types) for setup.\n",
