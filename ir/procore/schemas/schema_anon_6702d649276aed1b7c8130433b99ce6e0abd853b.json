Each key corresponds to an axis and each value corresponds to a value along that axis. Specifically, the keys are WBS Segment IDs hyphenated with the tier depth in that segment. This object will return data for all requested axes whether the work is broken down to that level or not and will not return data for axes that are not requested. When sorting by an axis, the rows will be naturally sorted by the Segment Item Code, and when filtering or grouping, rows will be filtered or grouped by the Segment Item ID.",
