  "description": "The ID of the sub job this timecard entry is associated with. This is legacy - don't use if you have WBS codes. Used for more granular project cost tracking and reporting. This represents construction project subdivision for detailed cost control, such as Building A versus Building B or Phase 1 versus Phase 2. It enables separate cost tracking for different contract phases or building components and allows separate billing and progress reporting for distinct project phases or structures. Modern projects should use wbs_code_id instead for better task-based tracking. See [List Sub Jobs](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/sub-jobs#list-sub-jobs) to retrieve available sub jobs for the project.\n",
