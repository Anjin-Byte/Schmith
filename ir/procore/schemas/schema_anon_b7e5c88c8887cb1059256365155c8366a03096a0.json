This represents the traditional construction cost accounting system for tracking labor costs against budget line items. This older approach to construction cost tracking is being replaced by WBS/Task codes in modern projects but still links labor hours directly to original project budget estimates for cost control. Cannot be used with wbs_code_id as they represent different cost tracking methodologies. See [List Cost Codes](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/cost-codes#list-cost-codes) to retrieve available cost codes for your project.\n",
