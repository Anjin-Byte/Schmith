This construction trade classification system tracks skilled labor types and wage rates, often aligning with union trade classifications for proper wage and benefit calculations. It enables analysis of labor mix and skill requirements across construction projects and is critical for public works projects requiring specific trade wage rates. See [List all classifications](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/work-classification-project-level#list-all-classifications) to retrieve available work classifications for your project.\n",
