Then, when an employee opens their electronic vault, it is reported as `activated`. However the owner of an electronic vault can request its deletion. When it is the case, the state of the Electronic Vault is updated to `pending_deletion`. When the deletion is effective, the state of the Electronic Vault is then `deleted`. At last, when `electronic_vault_subscription_enabled` is set to `false`, the employee can not open an electronic vault, its state is then `not_available`",
