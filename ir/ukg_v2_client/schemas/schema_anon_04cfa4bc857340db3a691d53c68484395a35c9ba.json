  "description": "A dataset is a set of dimensions organized hierarchically. Dimensions are in this regard similar to levels. Every value in the Dataset is then attached to a dimension. Dimensions have to be created in the same order as the hierarchy they represent (e.g.:create the dimension `countries` first before creating the dimension `cities`) Example: we could have a dataset of job codes for a global retail manufacturer. The dimensions could be: country, region, city, shop. There is a set of values in every dimension. And the dataset of job codes for one of the London retail stores could be accessed via `united_kingdom.greater_london.london.N42LE`. Warning: A dataset cannot have more than 10 dimensions.",
