  "description": "IsTransfer property serves as an indicator in identifying a transfer punch.\nWhen set to 'true' this property designates a punch as a transfer punch.\nTo appropriately handle a transfer punch ensure that the 'PunchStatusType' is set to value 'Transfer' when sending a payload.\nIf 'PunchStatusType' is set to a value other then 'Transfer' and 'IsTransfer' is set to 'true', PunchStatusType value will get ignored in most of the cases.\nTransfer punch is essential for tracking and management of employee transfers during the working hours.\nTransfer punches find their use in scenarios where an employee undergoes a change in department or labor type.\nBy adding a transfer punch the application effectively captures these transitions\nproviding an overview of employee movements between different departments or labor types.",
